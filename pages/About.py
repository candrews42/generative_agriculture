# Introduction
st.write("""
**Colin Andrews**  is the farm manager at Learn to Grow Outdoor Educational Center and Regenerative Farm, applying modern systems engineering to natural processes to build methods that directly address several UN sustainable development goals and are immediately useful to regenerating the ecology of Bahrain and the Gulf region.

Colin has had a diverse career in **strategy consulting and analytics for global end-to-end supply chain, systems engineering for blockchain-based local energy communities**, and the **integration of artificial intelligence algorithms into energy market trading**. He is just as comfortable coding on an overnight train in India, getting his hands dirty on a farm in Bahrain, and presenting in a New York City board room.
