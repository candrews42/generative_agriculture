    - [Task Manager](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_1_Task_Manager) :: Shows how farm task management can be assisted by AI.
    - [Database](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_2_Database) :: Demonstrates how databases can be queried with natural language, removing the need for training in SQL or data analysis.
    - [Plant Detective](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_3_Plant_Detective) :: A plant identifier that lets people identify and collect the plants around them like Pokemon Go.
    - [Librarian](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_4_Librarian) :: Trained on farm data, currently able to query recent observations from Plant Detective.
    - [Farmers Market](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_5_Farmers_Market) :: Shows how multi-attribute double-auctions can be adapted for an online farmer's market.
    - [Image Assets](https://generativeagriculture.streamlit.app/Demo_6_Image_Assets) :: Pictures of physical farm assets can be automatically translated into digital assets for a Farmville-style interface, but for your actual farm or garden.

    We're a few sprints away from our first fully functional tool. We are actively **seeking funding** to **hire a developer** to productionalize our proof of concepts so that focus can be shifted to finalizing the systems design. Our system is **already being used** to gather observations, track harvests, and manage task lists on our farm, with many more functions to come, including blockchain for community-validated proof of origin and an on-chain farmer's market.""")
